**Task 3:-**

The price of a car depends on a lot of factors like the goodwill of the brand of the car, features of the car, horsepower and the mileage it gives and many more. Car price prediction is one of the major research areas in the field of machine learning.Task is to build a price prediction model.

1. Gather relevant data on car attributes and other factors
2. Preprocessing the data by cleaning, handling missing values and encoding variables
3. Visualizing the dependency of attribute in price prediction by plotting graphs
4. Creating Heatmap to find correlation
5. Splitting the dataset into training and testing datasets
6. Building a LR model 
7. Evaluating its performance by finding accuracy
